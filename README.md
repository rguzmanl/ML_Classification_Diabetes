# ML_Classification_Diabetes
Trying different classification algorithms on a diabetes [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/towfeeqf/diabetes-prediction-ml/data) from Kaggle. I worked on this simple dataset as I was a reading about the corresponding algorithms. 

## Algorithms used:
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* And Linear Models for Calssification:
  * Logistic Regression
  * Suport Vector Machines
